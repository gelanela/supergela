            <h2>Luke</h2>
            <p>
                Summary of the Gospel of Luke
                This summary of the Gospel of Luke provides information about the title, author(s), date of writing,
                chronology, theme, theology, outline, a brief overview, and the chapters of the Gospel of Luke.
                <br>
                <br>
                Author
                The author's name does not appear in the book, but much unmistakable evidence points to Luke. This
                Gospel is a companion volume to the book of Acts, and the language and structure of these two books
                indicate that both were written by the same person. They are addressed to the same individual,
                Theophilus, and the second volume refers to the first (Ac 1:1). Certain sections in Acts use the pronoun
                "we" (Ac 16:10-17; 20:5-15; 21:1-18; 27:1 -- 28:16), indicating that the author was with Paul when the
                events described in these passages took place. By process of elimination, Paul's "dear friend Luke, the
                doctor" (Col 4:14) and "fellow worker" (Phm 24), becomes the most likely candidate. His authorship is
                supported by the uniform testimony of early Christian writings (e.g., the Muratorian Canon, a.d. 170,
                and the works of Irenaeus, c. 180).
                <br>  <br>
                Luke was probably a Gentile by birth, well educated in Greek culture, a physician by profession, a
                companion of Paul at various times from his second missionary journey to his final imprisonment in Rome,
                and a loyal friend who remained with the apostle after others had deserted him (2Ti 4:11).
                <br>  <br>
                Antioch (of Syria) and Philippi are among the places suggested as his hometown.
                <br>  <br>
                Recipient and Purpose
                The Gospel is specifically directed to Theophilus (1:3), whose name means "one who loves God" and almost
                certainly refers to a particular person rather than to lovers of God in general. The use of "most
                excellent" with the name further indicates an individual, and supports the idea that he was a Roman
                official or at least of high position and wealth. He was possibly Luke's patron, responsible for seeing
                that the writings were copied and distributed. Such a dedication to the publisher was common at that
                time.
                <br>  <br>
                Theophilus, however, was more than a publisher. The message of this Gospel was intended for his own
                instruction (1:4) as well as the instruction of those among whom the book would be circulated. The fact
                that the Gospel was initially directed to Theophilus does not narrow or limit its purpose. It was
                written to strengthen the faith of all believers and to answer the attacks of unbelievers. It was
                presented to displace some disconnected and ill-founded reports about Jesus (see 1:1-4 and note). Luke
                wanted to show that the place of the Gentile Christian in God's kingdom is based on the teaching of
                Jesus. He wanted to commend the preaching of the gospel to the whole world.
                <br>  <br>
                Date and Place of Writing
                The two most commonly suggested periods for dating the Gospel of Luke are: (1) a.d. 59-63, and (2) the
                70s or the 80s (see essay and chart, p. 1943).

                The place of writing was probably Rome, though Achaia, Ephesus and Caesarea have also been suggested.
                The place to which it was sent would, of course, depend on the residence of Theophilus. By its detailed
                designations of places in the Holy Land, the Gospel seems to be intended for readers who were unfamiliar
                with that land. Antioch, Achaia and Ephesus are possible destinations.
                <br>  <br>
                Style
                Luke had outstanding command of the Greek language. His vocabulary is extensive and rich, and his style
                at times approaches that of classical Greek (as in the preface, 1:1-4), while at other times it is quite
                Semitic (1:5 -- 2:52) -- often like the Septuagint (the pre-Christian Greek translation of the OT).

                Characteristics
                The third Gospel presents the works and teachings of Jesus that are especially important for
                understanding the way of salvation. Its scope is complete from the birth of Christ to his ascension, its
                arrangement is orderly, and it appeals to both Jews and Gentiles. The writing is characterized by
                literary excellence, historical detail and warm, sensitive understanding of Jesus and those around him.
                <br>
                Since the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) report many of the same episodes in Jesus' life, one
                would expect much similarity in their accounts. The dissimilarities reveal the distinctive emphases of
                the separate writers. Luke's characteristic themes include: (1) universality, recognition of Gentiles as
                well as Jews in God's plan (see, e.g., 2:30-32 and notes on 2:31; 3:6); (2) emphasis on prayer,
                especially Jesus' praying before important occasions (see note on 3:21); (3) joy at the announcement of
                the gospel or "good news" (see note on 1:14); (4) special concern for the role of women (see, e.g.,
                8:1-3 and notes); (5) special interest in the poor (some of the rich were included among Jesus'
                followers, but he seemed closest to the poor; see note on 12:33); (6) concern for sinners (Jesus was a
                friend to those deep in sin); (7) stress on the family circle (Jesus' activity included men, women and
                children, with the setting frequently in the home); (8) repeated use of the Messianic title "Son of Man"
                (used 25 times; see 19:10; Da 7:13 and notes); (9) emphasis on the Holy Spirit (see note on 4:1); (10)
                inclusion of more parables than any other Gospel; (11) emphasis on praising God (see 1:64; 24:53 and
                notes).

                Sources
                Although Luke acknowledges that many others had written of Jesus' life (1:1), he does not indicate that
                he relied solely on these reports for his own writing. He used personal investigation and arrangement,
                based on testimony from "eyewitnesses and servants of the word" (1:2) -- including the preaching and
                oral accounts of the apostles. His language differences from the other Synoptics and his blocks of
                distinctive material (e.g., 10:1 -- 18:14; 19:1 -- 28) indicate independent work, though he obviously
                used some of the same sources (see essay, p. 1943).

                Plan
                Luke's account of Jesus' ministry can be divided into three major parts: (1) the events that occurred in
                and around Galilee (4:14 -- 9:50), (2) those that took place in Judea and Perea (9:51 -- 19:27), and (3)
                those of the final week in Jerusalem (19:28 -- 24:53). Luke's uniqueness is especially seen in the
                amount of material devoted to Jesus' closing ministry in Judea and Perea. This material is predominantly
                made up of accounts of Jesus' discourses. Twenty-one of the 28 parables that occur in Luke are found in
                10:30 -- 19:27. Of the 20 miracles recorded in Luke, only 5 appear in 9:51 -- 19:27. Already in the
                ninth chapter (see note on 9:51), Jesus is seen anticipating his final appearance in Jerusalem and his
                crucifixion (see note on 13:22).

                The main theme of the Gospel is the nature of Jesus' Messiahship and mission, and a key verse is 19:10.
